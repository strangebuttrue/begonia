The accordion system is a two-dimensional harmony system inspired by (but NOT the same as) the Stradella bass buttonboard of an accordion. It's a matrix of 180 Major-7 and Minor-7 chords arranged on two axes we can call "Key" and "Harmony". Each axis is scanned by sending 0-10 volts to the appropriate input. 

The Key axis of this matrix is a regular circle-of-fourths sequence (C,F,Bb,Eb,...G), but the other axis (Harmony) is more interesting. I'll explain:

7th chords contain four pitches. This means that a given pitch - let's say C natural - appears in four 7th chords of a given type. For instance, C appears in four Major-7 chords:

C Maj7 (C,E,G,B)
Ab Maj7 (Ab,C,Eb,G)
F Maj7 (F,A,C,E)
Db Maj7 (Db,F,Ab,C)

And four Minor-7 chords:

C Min7 (C,Eb,G,Bb)
A Min7 (A,C,E,G)
F Min7 (F,Ab,C,Eb)
D Min7 (D,F,A,C)

Looking over this list of chords we see that while they all contain C-natural, C is playing a different role in each. The C in a Db Major-7 chord is tense and unresolved; it's the leading tone, and sounds dissonant when played against the root, Db. On the other hand, the C in a C Major-7 is the tonic, the center of its own little harmonic universe. 


These eight chords can be arranged in an order that is not exactly, but sort of, "most dissonant relative to C-natural" to "least dissonant relative to C-natural". As I reckon, that order looks like this:

Db Maj7 (Db,F,Ab,C)
Ab Maj7 (Ab,C,Eb,G)
F Min7 (F,Ab,C,Eb)
C Min7 (C,Eb,G,Bb)
D Min7 (D,F,A,C)
A Min7 (A,C,E,G)
F Maj7 (F,A,C,E)
C Maj7 (C,E,G,B)

If we then mirror this eight chord sequence around the C Maj7, we get this fifteen-chord sequence:

Db Maj7
Ab Maj7
F Min7
C Min7
D Min7
A Min7
F Maj7
C Maj7
F Maj7
A Min7
D Min7
C Min7
F Min7
Ab Maj7
Db Maj7

This sequence is the Harmony axis of the Accordion System's matrix. Increment the Key axis by 0.8333 volts (one-twelfth of 10v) and you are now selecting from a similar table of chords, transposed by a fourth, each containing the pitch F-natural:

Gb Maj7
Db Maj7
Bb Min7
F Min7
G Min7
D Min7
Bb Maj7
F Maj7
Bb Maj7
D Min7
G Min7
F Min7
Bb Min7
Db Maj7
Gb Maj7

Raise the Key voltage a little higher and the Harmony voltage will now scan this same series transposed another fourth to a set of chords all containing Bb. Et cetera.
